      <p>
        For the most part, Ctrl was a really good album!
        After a rough start (I don't really like the first 3 songs), Ctrl becomes much better as it goes along.
        <br>
        While like ASTROWORLD, some songs sound too similar, it also has a lot of unique songs to balance it out.
        Most of the features are really good, and I love the speaker bits in the album, like in the beginning and ending songs.
        <br>
        I think it's slightly worse than Born To Die and DAMN., but it's still a really good album.

      <p>
        Sadly, I wasn't a huge fan of Astroworld, compared to the other albums.
        It's not like I dislike Travis - Utopia is one of my favorite albums of all time.
        <br>
        My main issue with Astroworld is that a lot of songs sound the same. I can't remember most of the songs, 
        while on Utopia, I remembered most songs after my first listen.
        <br>
        Maybe it's just me. Some songs are good and I like most features, but otherwise I didn't really like Astroworld.

        This was a GREAT album - on par with Born To Die. While I don't really like rap as a music genre, I enjoyed this album the whole way through.
        <br>
        Weirdly, my 3 favorite songs are also the 3 most popular on the album. DNA is just an amazing song, expecially with the shot toward Geraldo Rivera.
        <br>
        I don't really have that much to say, DAMN. is just a great album.

        I actually really liked this album! I think it's better than both <q>Awaken, My Love!</q> and beerbongs & bentleys.
        <br>
        I didn't expect to recognise so many songs from this album, like Born To Die, Diet Mountain Dew, National Anthem, Radio, and Million Dollar Man.
        <br>
        I like how every song sounds distinct, yet still in the same style.

        This album was a mixed bag. Many songs were good (the 5 below especially are great), but there were also many songs I didn't really like,
        including Rich & Sad, Takin' Shots, Otherside, and Blame It On Me.
        <br>
        The only other Post Malone album I've listened to was Hollywood's Bleeding, which is probably one of my 5 favorite albums of all time.
        I don't think beerbongs and bentleys was as good, so I'm glad Post Malone improved after this one.

        This album was interesting. I like how weird it got, and it was different from any other album I've heard before.
        Even Bando Stone and The New World (the only other album of Childish Gambino that I've listened to) sounds different than this.
        <br>
        However, I don't think this album was as good as Bando Stone and The New World. That's not to say it was bad - it had really good elements.
        <br>
        The production is insane; probably better than Bando Stone and The New World's. Me And Your Mama is better than even the best songs on Bando Stone and The New World.
        And I like the <q>story</q> in the album. It's a good album, just not for me unfortunately.
