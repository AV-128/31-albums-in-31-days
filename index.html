      <p>
        For this review, I'll shorten My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
        to MBDTF.
        <br>
        It was pretty good! I don't think it's good as Graduation, but it's pretty close!
        <br>
        One thing that MBDTF excels at is it's energy - every song, including songs that
        aren't as quick, like All Of The Lights (Interlude) and Runaway, keep an energy
        that make this album stand out.
        <br>
        I thought most features were good, the biggest standout being Nicki Minaj on
        Monster.
        <br>
        While I will admit that MBDTF peaks during the first half, the second half still
        has bangers, like Runaway and Who Will Survive In America.

        The new Post Malone album just came out!
        As the first country album I've listened to, it was pretty good.
        <br>
        The biggest thing I have to say about the album is that there aren't any skips.
        While some songs aren't that good, such as the first 2, they aren't terrible
        either.
        <br>
        A small negative, I thought that most features were unnecessary, other than a few
        songs.
        <br>
        But aside from that, this album just has so many good songs - like the top 5.

        Another Bruno Mars album!
        <br>
        I didn't originally plan to do another one, but Doo-Wops & Hooligans was
        so good, so I decided to listen to Unorthodox Jukebox.
        <br>
        So, how's this one?
        <br>
        While not as good as Doo-Wops & Hooligans, I still thought it was pretty good!
        Even more than Doo-Wops & Hooligans, I think the production is great. While good,
        the production in Doo-Wops & Hooligans wasn't a large focus, in my opinion, other
        than in songs such as Our First Time or Marry You.
        <br>
        By contrast, many songs, such as Young Girls or When I Was Your Man, are almost
        carried by their production.

        I NEVER LIKED YOU is a good album that I don't have much to say about.
        <br>
        That's it - I think it's good, but I don't have that many opinions about it.
        <br>
        The only thing I have to say is this - I've listened to three Future albums
        (I NEVER LIKED YOU, WE DON'T TRUST YOU, WE STILL DON'T TRUST YOU), and in
        all of them, the first song was my favorite.
        <br>
        That's kinda cool.

      <p>
        Might as well do another album from a controversial artist!
        <br>
        I didn't know what to expect from Alone At Prom, and I think it's pretty good.
        <br>
        I don't know why Enchanted Waterfall isn't available on Spotify, but after
        hearing it on YouTube, it makes me so mad because ITS SO GOOD!
        <br>
        Most of the other songs are fine, but my biggest problem is that no song
        does anything that different from any of the other ones. Like ASTROWORLD and
        Take Care, a lot of songs sound basically the same.
        <br>
        Still, this was a pretty good album, and Lavender Sunflower is probably a top
        three song from any album this month.

        I haven't had the best record with rap albums this month. With me not being a
        huge fan of ASTROWORLD, Take Care, and The College Dropout, I didn't have
        high hopes for HARDSTONE PSYCHO - so I'm pleased to say that I actualy really
        liked this album!
        <br>
        While I'm not a huge fan of Don Toliver's voice, his rapping style and the way
        the songs flow more than make up for it.
        <br>
        This is my first Don Toliver album, and I'll probably listen to another one of
        his albums this month.

        RENAISSANCE was an AMAZING album!
        <br>
        I think it's even better than Doo-Wops & Hooligans. It just has so many good songs,
        and, out of the albums so far, is the album I want to relisten to the most!
        <br>
        Yes, a lot of songs sound similar, but I don't mind that much here, since every
        song is great. Also, this sounds different from most albums, and other than Bando
        Stone and The New World, is the weirdest sounding album I've listened to.
        <br>
        This album actually made me want to listen to more Beyoncé albums. The only other
        album I was going to listen to this month was COWBOY CARTER, but I'm probably gonna
        add more albums, like her title album and Lemonade.

      <p>
        *sigh*
        <br>
        The College Dropout! This is often seen as one of Kanye's best albums.
        I, personally, have only listened to 2 Kanye albums - Graduation and 808s & Heartbreak.
        <br>
        I thought 808s & Heartbreak was pretty good, and I loved Graduation, and after hearing
        that this was one of Kanye's best, I was excited.
        <br>
        Unfortunately, this is worse than both in my opinion. Still good, but there 
        are lots of things that I don't really like.
        <br>
        First, I feel like this album has too many interludes.
        Some are good (like School Spirit Skit 1), but others aren't as good (like Workout Plan).
        <br>
        Second, while I love the theme of college, I feel like some songs
        sound more like Kanye venting than actual songs. Sometimes it sounds like he's speaking
        in a song, rather than rapping.
        <br>
        But, there are great things about this album as well! As mentioned before, the themes are 
				great, and honestly took me aback. Also, this is honestly a perfect first album.
				<br>
				I'm definitely in the minority here, so I might relisten to this album
				and maybe I'll like it more.

        Another great album! While slightly worse than Doo-Wops & Hooligans, it's not bad at all.
        <br>
        Like with Childish Gambino, Post Malone, and Travis Scott, I've already listened
        to one of Rihanna's albums before, that being ANTI. While it's one of her most popular
        albums, I wasn't as big of a fan of it. In my opinion, Loud is a much better album!
        <br>
        It may be ordinary, but Only Girl is such a good song, and maybe my favorite Rihanna song!

        I did a Kendrick song 4 days ago, so might as well do a Drake song now!
        <br>
        Sadly, wasn't a huge fan of Take Care. It has the same problem as ASTROWORLD,
        with the songs being way too similar. The problem isn't as extreme as ASTROWORLD,
        but it still was an issue.
        <br>
        There were some standouts, like Crew Love and Headlines, but otherwise I didn't like
        this album that much.

        Like, it might be my favorite album out of these seven!
        <br>
        First off, while it doesn't matter at all, this might be one of my favorite album covers ever.
        <br>
        Anyways, this album just has no skips. Even though I'm not a big fan of some songs,
        like Our First Time and The Lazy Song, they aren't bad at all.
        <br>
        I may also be biased, since I've already heard 6 of these songs before, but still, this was a great album.

        For the most part, Ctrl was a really good album!
        After a rough start (I don't really like the first 3 songs), Ctrl becomes much better as it goes along.
        <br>
        While like ASTROWORLD, some songs sound too similar, it also has a lot of unique songs to balance it out.
        Most of the features are really good, and I love the speaker bits in the album, like in the beginning and ending songs.
        <br>
        I think it's slightly worse than Born To Die and DAMN., but it's still a really good album.

        Sadly, I wasn't a huge fan of Astroworld, compared to the other albums.
        It's not like I dislike Travis - Utopia is one of my favorite albums of all time.
        <br>
        My main issue with Astroworld is that a lot of songs sound the same. I can't remember most of the songs, 
        while on Utopia, I remembered most songs after my first listen.
        <br>
        Maybe it's just me. Some songs are good and I like most features, but otherwise I didn't really like Astroworld.

        This was a GREAT album - on par with Born To Die. While I don't really like rap as a music genre, I enjoyed this album the whole way through.
        <br>
        Weirdly, my 3 favorite songs are also the 3 most popular on the album. DNA is just an amazing song, expecially with the shot toward Geraldo Rivera.
        <br>
        I don't really have that much to say, DAMN. is just a great album.

        I actually really liked this album! I think it's better than both <q>Awaken, My Love!</q> and beerbongs & bentleys.
        <br>
        I didn't expect to recognise so many songs from this album, like Born To Die, Diet Mountain Dew, National Anthem, Radio, and Million Dollar Man.
        <br>
        I like how every song sounds distinct, yet still in the same style.

        This album was a mixed bag. Many songs were good (the 5 below especially are great), but there were also many songs I didn't really like,
        including Rich & Sad, Takin' Shots, Otherside, and Blame It On Me.
        <br>
        The only other Post Malone album I've listened to was Hollywood's Bleeding, which is probably one of my 5 favorite albums of all time.
        I don't think beerbongs and bentleys was as good, so I'm glad Post Malone improved after this one.

        This album was interesting. I like how weird it got, and it was different from any other album I've heard before.
        Even Bando Stone and The New World (the only other album of Childish Gambino that I've listened to) sounds different than this.
        <br>
        However, I don't think this album was as good as Bando Stone and The New World. That's not to say it was bad - it had really good elements.
        <br>
        The production is insane; probably better than Bando Stone and The New World's. Me And Your Mama is better than even the best songs on Bando Stone and The New World.
        And I like the <q>story</q> in the album. It's a good album, just not for me unfortunately.
